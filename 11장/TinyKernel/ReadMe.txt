       Windows CE Workspace: TinyKernel
========================================================================


The New Platform Wizard has created the TinyKernel workspace for you.

The following list shows the files that this workspace contains:

	
TinyKernel.ncb
    The No Compile Browser file, containing information generated by the parser, and which is used by the IDE.

TinyKernel.opt
    The options file for your OS design, which stores information about the options that you select for your workspace. This enables you to modify the workspace and the user interface according to your needs.
	
TinyKernel.pbxml
    The Platform Builder XML-based metadata file, which stores the environment and build data that includes Catalog items and projects in your OS design.

TinyKernel.Pbxml.user
    The Workspace Favorites file, which stores information about items you add to your favorites.

The %_PBWORKSPACES%\TinyKernel\WINCE500\<BSP>\oak path is copied from the design template on which your OS design is based.  The workspace files in this directory include Project.bib and Cesysgen.bat.  Additional files in this directory vary depending on which design template you select when creating your OS design.

Your workspace links to the following files in %_WINCEROOT%\Public\Common\Oak\Files: Common.bib, Common.dat, Common.db, and Common.reg.

Your workspace also links to the following files in %_WINCEROOT%\Platform\<BSP>\Files: Config.bib, Platform.bib, Platform.dat, Platform.db, and Platform.reg.
